# April-5-Stream-Code-Hangman-
The program that we wrote on April 5th 2020 on a live Twitch stream! Twitch chat gave me ideas for coding projects and I did my best to implement them! Enjoy and feel free to play around with my code and share what you make!

I've inlcuded a pre-packaged installer and the raw Python code as well! Feel free to use either!

## In this stream we:
Helped a Python student debugg their code and made a god-awful game of hangman that you can play against the computer!
